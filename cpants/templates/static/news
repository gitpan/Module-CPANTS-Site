<dt>2007-10-29: new optional metric: <i>use_warnings</i></dt>
<dd>
I've added a new metric: <code>use_warnings</code>. This metric checks if all of your modules include a line like 'use warnings;'. As this does not work for old Perls, I've made it an optional metric (for now..). 
<br><br>
A patch submitted by Adriano Ferreira enhances MANIFEST-checking (and removes a bug caused by chdir). See RT #28982 for details.
<br><br>
Andy Armstrong suggested to also look in <code>xt/</code> for tests, because this is becoming the new place for optional author tests (like pod-coverage). Which I implemented...
<br><br>
I've also re-analysed all of CPAN. The only thing left to do now (besides adding more metrics) is to make the various graphs work again...
</dd>


<dt>2007-07-13: CPANTS up again</dt>
<dd>The server now has more memory (Thanks, Andy!), so CPANTS is back to a regular update interval of once a day. I had to revert some of the recent changes, though, so various patches sent in by Barbie and Gabor are not live at the moment.
<br>
Additionally, I'm now off for one month of trecking in Mongolia, with no net access. So if CPANTS has a problem again, I won't be able to tend to it until end of August (where I won't have much time either, thanks to <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org">YAPC::Europe</a>).
</dd>

<dt>2007-06-15: CPANTS down</dt>
<dd>Due to some problems that CPANTS caused on the server (taking to much
memory..) currently no new data is beeing calculated. And the data shown might
be wrong... I do hope to find some time to fix this, but it't not going to
happen today.</dd>
<dt>2007-04-23: New releases<dt>
<dd>
I've fixed lots of bugs reported via RT and email. Thanks for the hints and patches! Quality of CPANTS data should be a bit better now...
</dd>

<dt>2007-04-02: Old metrics<dt>
<dd>Now that April 1sth is over, we're back to the regular metrics...</dd>

<dt>2007-04-01: New metrics</dt>
<dd>Thanks to Catalyst & DBIx::Class I finished my <a
href="http://oe1.orf.at">$big_project</a> a bit early. I
used this time to implement a few long-pending metrics:

<ul>
<li>docs_make_sense
<li>mentions_kwalitee
<li>uses_version_control
<li>reuses_code
<li>uses_recursion
<li>correct_speling
<li>nice_code_layout
</ul>

You can find a more detailed description <a

Happy gaming!</dd>

<dt>2007-03-10: New server! SQLite Dump!</dt>
<dd>CPANTS now lives on a <b>new server provided by <a
href="http://hexten.net">hexten.net</a></b>. Thanks!!<br>
Starting tomorrow, there will again be daily updates, so you can now continue
playing the CPANTS game and raising your kwalitee (and hopefully making CPAN a
nicer place in the process...)<br><br>

Thanks to the nice <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-PgLite/">DBD::PgLite::MirrorPgToSQLite</a>
there is now a daily SQLite dump of the CPANTS database available. I hope you
won't get blind from looking at the schema...<br>
You can get the latest dump from this URL: <a
href="http://cpants.perl.org/static/sqlite/cpants_all.db.gz">http://cpants.perl.org/static/sqlite/cpants_all.db.gz</a>.<br>
Have fun playing with the data!

<dt>2006-11-04: metayml_conforms_spec_1_0 and _current</dt>
<dd>After some discussions on perl-qa I split metayml_conforms_spec into metayml_conforms_spec_1_0 and
metayml_conforms_spec_current (which is an optional metric).</dd>

<dt>2006-10-30: More Graphs & has_license changes</dt>
<dd>There are now graphs showing the kwalitee of a distribution and the
average kwalitee and number of dists of an author over time. They are located
at the bottom of the authors page and the kwalitee detail page of a dist. I
also reworked the has_license metric a bit. It has been replaced by
has_humanreadable_license, metayml_has_license and the new
metayml_conforms_spec.</dd>

<dt>2006-09-28: Cronjob</dt>
<dd>I finally managed to set up a working cronjob for CPANTS. You can expect new data each day around 02:45 EDT. Only newly uploaded dists will be checked daily. I will only do a full run (which takes some hours) if there's a change to the metrics.</dd>

<dt>2006-09-26: Revamped Website</dt>
<dd>Thanks to the incredibly helpful <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bricas/">Brian Cassidy</a> the site is now working much better than before. He submitted several patches that cleaned up my horrible Catalyst code in Module::CPANTS::Site.</dd>

<dt>2006-09-13: has_license</dt>
<dd>A new metric, implemented by <a href="http://www.szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>, has_license checks if there is a license specified in META.yml. This metric will be soon enhances to also look in other places for a license.</dt>

<dt>2006-09-05: New metrics</dt>
<dd>During YAPC::Europe 2007 I did a small CPANTS hackathon, which resulted in several new metrics: manifest_matches_dist, buildtool_not_executable and has_exampel (which is an optional metric).<br>
I also changed the authors page a bit so: optional metrics are now clearly marked as such.
</dd>

<dt>2006-07-19</dt>
<dd>
Added News section<br>
New metric: <code>has_working_buildtool</code>. Thanks to <a href="http://steffen-mueller.net">Steffen MÃ¼ller</a> for suggesting & implementing it!
Re-indexed the whole of CPAN.
</dd>
<dt>2006-07-18</dt>
<dd>
Added support for optional metrics (eg <code>is_prereq</code>).<br>
Changed Kwalitee from absolut to relative values (i.e. percentages)<br>
Changed ranking in CPANTS game to only use non-optional metrics. Now releasing a new distribution (which fulfills all core metrics) won't lower owns rank.
</dd>
