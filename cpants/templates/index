<p>CPANTS is an acronym for <b>CPAN</b> <b>T</b>esting <b>S</b>ervice. The goals of the CPANTS project are to provide some sort of quality measure (called <b>"<a href="/kwalitee.html">Kwalitee</a>"</b>) and lots of metadata for all distributions on CPAN.</p>

<p>Please take all the information presented here with a grain of salt. The methods used to test the distributions are a bit flakey, and some of the Kwalitee indicators are still subjects of discussions (which should happen on the <a href="http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-qa">perl-qa</a> list).</p>

<dt>2008-01-14: up again</dt>
<dd>After a very long downtime caused by a combination of Christmas and me
changing jobs, CPANTS will be soon back up to regular (daily) updates. I'm
currently in the middle of setting things up on a new server provided by <a
href="http://vienna.pm.org">Vienna.pm</a>. cpants.perl.org already points to
the new server.<br>
Thanks for your patience, and sorry for any inconveniences...

<dt>2007-11-07: better data</dt>
<dd>
I fixed a few bugs and generated new data (which took a bit more than 6 hours). But nothing fancy...
</dd>

<dt>2007-10-30: reworked dist view</dt>
<dd>
The view for a dist is now broken up into several subpages. This makes the data more easy to read. I've also fixed some minor problems in the list of prereqs etc (links are now going to the dist each module is in).

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>CPANTS is not about running the test suite that most distributions ship with. This is done by the <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/">CPAN testers</a>.</p>

<p>One big limitation of CPANTS is that it cannot actually execute any code: The module might not run on the machine doing the testing, it might have third-party dependencies, etc. CPANTS can only gather data and Kwalitee by looking at files, source code etc. This means that there are a lot of bugs in the Kwalitee-calculating code. Don't take everything here too serious! In a future version it might be possible to collect metadata from various distributed testers who run the tests on different platforms and settings (as CPAN testers do).</p>
