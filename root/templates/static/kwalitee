<h1>Kwalitee</h1>

<h3>What's "Kwalitee", anyway?</h3>

<p>I'll hand the micropohone over to Schwern (or rather: I'll copy'n'paste from his <a href="http://schwern.org/~schwern/talks/CPANTS/">old CPANTS slides</a>):

<pre>
  What is a good module? That's hard to say.
  
  What is good code? That's also hard to say.
  
  "Quality" is not a well-defined term in computing ... and especially not Perl.

  One man's Thing of Beauty is another's man's Evil Hack
  
  Since we can't define quality, how do we write a program to assure it?
</pre>
  
<p>Schwern decided to cleverly avoid this problem by not testing for quality but for Kwalitee: It looks like quality, it sounds like quality, but it's not quite quality.</p>
