# Dists

* rearrange dist/view
  - core infos:
    name, author, version, release date, kwalitee
  - howto improve kwalitee
  - kwalitee matrix
  - history
  - dependencie tree
  - listed prereqs
  - other dists using ... (recursive ?)
  - modules provided
  - stuff used
  - metadata

* AJAXify dist/view

* various statistic views
  (sorted by prereqs, by depenecies, ..)

- Display the real errors as seen by CPANTS.
  e.g. http://cpants.perl.org/dist/overview/STAFService shows a Pod error
  and missing use strict. It would be nice if CPANTS could display the
  error code (in the pod case) or the file(s) that have no use strict.

- One of the modules failing the extractable metric
  http://cpants.perl.org/dist/shortcoming?metric=extractable
  is http://cpants.perl.org/dist/overview/Catalyst-Plugin-Imager
  but it does not seem to be on CPAN at all.
  The same seems to be true to all 8 distros in this category.

- pls display the number of failing distros for each metric
  on the http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html page too

- Add a page to show the results of the Phalanx 100
  http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/
